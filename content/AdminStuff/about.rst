The Inception, or the beginning of a project; this site is to contain
initially a group of disjointed ideas. Over time some of those ideas
(projects) should take on a life of their own and become extended
branches of ideas while other ideas will stub for lack of growth. As
each idea has a learning curve and its own growth rate, many of the
projects will eventually coalesce into something useful, one hopes.

So in a nutshell, this site is to explore different ideas and possibly
collaborate with some friends and acquaintances on projects that could
end up being nothing more than simply toys. But then again â€¦

More to follow.
