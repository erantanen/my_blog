python
......

Why use python?

| it's is open source
| it was created by Guido Van Rossum

| It has a ton of modules
| It was some crazy software built with it such as `blender <https://www.blender.org/>`_
| or `flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_

| and for more background its wiki is @ `Python <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>`_


python shell
............

From a terminal windows type "``Python``"

| you should see >>>

| type print("hello world")

What are the results when you run the code in python?

=====

| blah = 1.2

newblah = blah * 4
    Result of newblah?

intblah = int(newblah)
    Result of intblah?

=====

``unary vs binary vs ternary vs logic``

We now have logic to worry about.

.. code-block:: c

     blah = 5
     if blah = 5:
        print("ich")

     if blah == 5:
        print("ich")

     if blah != 5:
        print("ich")
