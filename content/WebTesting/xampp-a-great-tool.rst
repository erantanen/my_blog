Just wanted to  throw out a  good word for
`xampp <http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html>`__.

As I am trying to build up a collaborative space there seems to be a bit
of free time here and there (ie coffee shop); server side scripts are a
bit of a challenge to design/build. This is were xampp comes in to play
it gives you the abliliy to quickly start up services/daemons for
Apache/MySQL/FTP vi a gui control or if you prefer command line is
available as well.  Currently I have it working on MacOS and Ubuntu both
are working great. Yes I know I could get all those running on both of
those environments, the control set is very slick in how it can be fired
up for dev on very short notice.
